# Online-Payment-Fraud-Detection
This project applies machine learning techniques to detect fraudulent online transactions by handling class imbalance and reducing model overfitting through effective data preprocessing. XGBoost is used as the primary classification model due to its robustness and ability to generalize well to unseen transaction data.
